### _Getting started:_

The goal for this app was to create a fully functional web app with CRUD out of "MEN" stack programming languages.  Rho is named after a "thoeretical greek" which is responsible for a portion of the pricing in derivatives of underlying securities like stocks.  The intent with the overall app is to allow the user to experience the stock market and consume a 3rd Party API to provide market data for free! 

### _Technologies Used:_ 

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Google OAuth2
* MongoDB
* Mongoose ODM
* Express
* Node.js
* 3rd Party API for market data = IEX Cloud [Check out IEX Cloud Site](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/#stock-prices)


### _Project Goals:_ 

* Build a full stack app that utilizes MongdoDB, Express, and Node.js! 
* Educate users of the app on an ever-evolving app that helps them understand how the stock market works.
* Utilize HTML, CSSC, and JavaScript in concert to make a functional web browser game. 


### _Pseudocode:_

* AAU - I want to be able to have a landing page that I log in to
* Utilize Google OAuth to allow user to log in with Google 
* Once I'm logged in, I should get defaulted to index page with other user's porfolio for comparison purposes. 
* If there's no portfolio made yet, e.g. new user to site, allow for creating of portfolio via a new portfolio link
* Once a portfolio is made, this should turn the option for hte portfolio tab to "view" model instead of the "new"
* When user is looking at portfolio, cah balance should display and companies in portfolio as well. 
* When new stocks are bought or sold, the corresponding calculation to update my cash balance should be done in the controller
* There should be no ability to spend more than the defaulted amount of $10,000 
* Navigation should allow for portolfio show, new security, list in index of portfolios of all users, and a log out option

### _Resources Used:_

* Inspiration of wirefram came from a talented mock up by Julian Herbst via dribble.com with link in the wireframe. 
* Atlas to host MongoDB Cloud database to persist data
* Heroku to create link to the app for deployment
* GitHub for repositories and storage of data  



### Next Steps - Future Improvements: 

* Further tapping into the API for stock data variables

* Charting for the portfolio investments in a minized app format

* Proper ranking of all users, allow for new portfolio and start over twice

* Use by app users of options market to learn another side of investments in a risk free way with no cost
